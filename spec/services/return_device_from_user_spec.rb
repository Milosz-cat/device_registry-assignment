require 'rails_helper' # not 'rspec', becuase in Rails spec files, it is recommended to require 'rails_helper', not 'spec_helper' or 'rspec'. The 'rails_helper' file includes the 'spec_helper' file and also sets up the Rails environment, which is necessary for running tests that interact with the Rails framework

RSpec.describe ReturnDeviceFromUser do
  # TODO: Implement the tests for ReturnDeviceFromUser
end
