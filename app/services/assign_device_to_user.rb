    # - it was not possible to check if the user had owned the device more than once,
    # - the test logic was fragile - it was difficult to reproduce and confirm assignment/return cases.

    # For this reason, `device_ownerships` table was creted, which records:
    # - each time the device was assigned to the user (the `assigned_at` field),
    # - the time of return (the `returned_at` field),
    # - the ability to check if the user ever owned the device.
